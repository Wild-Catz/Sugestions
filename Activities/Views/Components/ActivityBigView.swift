                        Take the objects you choose and place them on a table. Sitting in front of the child, ask him to pass you an object by spelling out the name carefully.
                        
                        Donâ€™t worry if the child does not respond or is struggling, you can help him by pointing to the object in question or by placing his hands directly on it, aiming more and more to reduce the use of these aids.

                        After each successful exercise give him positive reinforcement, compliment him and/or high-five him (don't give him physical/sweet rewards just yet).

                        Finally, before repeating the exercise, repeat the name of the object in question to strengthen the association.

                        Remember to always speak very clearly.

                        Repeat this exercise several times but remember to change the order of the objects on the table.

                        At the end of the session you can reward the child with sweets or a more substantial reward.
